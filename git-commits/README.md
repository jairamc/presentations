# Better Git Commits
_A presentation about writing better git commits; how and why._

## Pre-requisites

This presentation uses `pandoc`, so you will need:

* `pandoc`
* `make`
* `git`

Ensure each are installed and available on your `PATH`. Each should be easily
available for all popular operating systems, though Windows might be a bit of
a stretch.

## Running

First get the dependencies: `make checkout`

Then build the presentation: `make index.html`

Then open the resulting `target/index.html` in your favourite web-browser.
